# Stack allocation VS Heap allocation
Let's break down the two lines:

1.  `B original(10, 20, arr, 999);` **(Stack Allocation)**
2.  `B* original = new B(10, 20, arr, 999);` **(Heap Allocation)**

Here is a detailed comparison.

### Comparison Table

| Feature                    | `B original(...);` (Stack)                                | `B* original = new B(...);` (Heap)                      |
| :------------------------- | :-------------------------------------------------------- | :---------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Memory Location**        | The **stack**. A small, highly managed region of memory.  | The **heap** (or "free store"). A large, flexible pool of memory. |
| **Lifetime & Management**  | **Automatic**. The object is destroyed when it goes out of scope (e.g., at the closing `}` of a function). | **Manual**. The object lives until you explicitly call `delete`. |
| **Variable Type**          | `original` is an **object** of type `B`.                  | `original` is a **pointer** of type `B*` that holds a memory address. |
| **Accessing Members**      | Use the **dot operator (`.`)**. `original.some_member`     | Use the **arrow operator (`->`)**. `original->some_member`  |
| **Speed**                  | **Very fast**. Allocation is just moving the stack pointer. | **Slower**. Involves finding a suitable block of memory.     |
| **Size Limitation**        | Limited by the stack size (typically a few MB). Can cause a **stack overflow** error. | Limited by available system RAM. Ideal for large objects.   |
| **Memory Leak Risk**       | **None**. The compiler handles deallocation for you.      | **High**. Forgetting `delete original;` will cause a memory leak. |

### Detailed Explanation

#### 1. Stack Allocation: `B original(...)`

This is the default and preferred way to create objects in C++.

*   **How it works:** When your function is called, a block of memory (a "stack frame") is reserved for all its local variables. `original` is created directly within this frame.

#### 2. Heap Allocation: `B* original = new B(...)`

This is used when you need more control over an object's lifetime or when the object is too large for the stack.

*   **How it works:** The `new` keyword does two things:
    1.  It requests a block of memory from the operating system (from the heap) that is large enough to hold a `B` object.
    2.  It calls the `B` constructor to initialize the object in that memory location and returns a **pointer** (the memory address) to it.
